# BrewLAN

***BrewLAN*** is a mod for *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance* that has been in on
and off development by a team of one for nearly a decade. It adds a wide variety
of new units for all factions, as well as offering several new game modes and
features. The core design goals for the mod are simple; to add new, interesting,
and visually aesthetic units which complement those already in existence and to
maximize technical compatibility with other mods. For more information, and
screenshots, visit the [ModDB page](http://www.moddb.com/mods/brewlan). For details
see the [*BrewLAN* wiki](https://github.com/The-Balthazar/BrewLAN/wiki). For
installation instructions see the
[installation page on the wiki](https://github.com/The-Balthazar/BrewLAN/wiki/Installation).
