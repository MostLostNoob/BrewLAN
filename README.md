# BrewLAN

**BrewLAN** is a mod for *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance* that has been in on and
off development by a team of one for nearly a decade. It adds a wide variety
of new units for all factions, as well as offering several new game modes and
features. The core design goals for the mod are simple; to add new, interesting,
and visually aesthetic units which complement those already in existence and to
maximize technical compatibility with other mods. For more information, screenshots,
and the community, visit its [ModDB page](http://www.moddb.com/mods/brewlan).

## Installation
If you are installing manually, make sure to remove any old versions of BrewLAN files first, then merge the contents of the `/maps/`, `/mods/`, and `/gamedata/` folders with that of *Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance*. If you have a fresh install, there may not be a `mods` folder.

Default locations are:
* `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\SteamApps\common\supreme commander forged alliance\`
* `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\THQ\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander - Forged Alliance\`

Alternatively, the `/mods/` and `/maps` folders can be installed into your documents folder. The `/gamedata/` folder can only be installed in the main directory. The documents folder location for the English language version of the game is:

* `%UserProfile%\My Documents\My Games\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander Forged Alliance\`

## Verification
If you did everything correctly, assuming installation entirely in the game directory rather than split between your documents and the directory, your game install should look like:
* Supreme Commander Forged Alliance
    * bin
        * ForgedAlliance.exe or SupremeCommander.exe on steam
        * ... (a bunch of .dll files and other files)
    * gamedata
        * brewlan.scd
        * cratedrop.scd
        * crystalhill.scd
        * experimentalicons.scd
        * tead.scd
        * lua.scd
        * units.scd
        * ... (a bunch of other .scd files)
    * maps
        * BREW_REEF
        * BREW_DEV
        * SCMP_001
        * ... (a bunch of other folders containing scenario data)
    * mods
        * BrewLAN
        * BrewLAN_Gameplay
        * BrewLAN_Modules
        * BrewLAN_Plenae
        * BrewLAN_RNG
        * BrewLAN_Units
        * ... (potentially other mod folders).
    * ... ('movies', 'sounds' and other folders)

If your installation looks like `/mods/brewlan/mods/brewlan` or `/mods/mods/` then there is an issue.
